Summary 
    This problem explains the structure of customer data and relationship between customer and bank. In R I used the k-NN to predict whether a new customer will accept a personal loan for Universal bank. This predictive model serves the basis of designing a campaign to target the potential loan customers more effectively. The choice of K should be based on the characteristics of data and the problem we are trying to solve. If the value is small the model become sensitive to noise and out liners in data and it can be too complex and closely to the data. If it is an intermediate value the over fitting and ignoring information balanced. 
    
   Confusion matrix for the validation data needs the actual class labels and predicted class labels based on k-NN models.

So I would like to add some info about this problems

- Train has a higher accuracy of 0.9772 when it compared to Test 0.9507
- Train has higher sensitivity of 0.7589 when it compared to Test 0.5875 (TPR)
- This indicates that Train's model is correct and identifying positive cases. It may have lower false negative rate
- The higher specificity is 0.9987 when compared to Test 0.99403

These above information were collected from the result of implementation and execution in R


# Problem Statement

  Universal bank is a young bank growing rapidly in terms of overall customer acquisition. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of relationship with the bank. The customer base of asset customers (borrowers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly in more loan business. In particular, it wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers.  
  
  A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise smarter campaigns with better target marketing. The goal is to use k-NN to predict whether a new customer will accept a loan offer. This will serve as the basis for the design of a new campaign.
  
  The file UniversalBank.csv contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customerâ€™s relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
  
  Partition the data into training (60%) and validation (40%) sets.

# Question (1)

Age = 40, Experience = 10, Income = 84, Family = 2, CCAvg = 2, Education_1 = 0, Education_2 = 1, Education_3 = 0, Mortgage = 0, Securities Account = 0, CD Account = 0, Online = 1, and Credit Card = 1. Perform a k-NN classification with all predictors except ID and ZIP code using k = 1. Remember to transform categorical predictors with more than two categories into dummy variables first. Specify the success class as 1 (loan acceptance), and use the default cutoff value of 0.5. How would this customer be classified?
